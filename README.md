# 🧠 QuizGameUoPeople

## 🧩 Overview
This project is a **Java console-based multiple-choice quiz game** developed as part of a University of the People programming assignment.  
It presents **five A–D multiple-choice questions**, validates each user input, and calculates the final score as a percentage.  
The code illustrates mastery of **conditional statements, loops, switch-case logic, and arithmetic operations**.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Presents **5 questions** with 4 possible answers (A–D) each  
- Validates input to accept only **A/B/C/D** (case-insensitive)  
- Uses a **switch-case** to check correctness  
- Provides immediate feedback (“Correct!” / “Incorrect.”)  
- Calculates and displays the **final score and percentage**  
- Demonstrates good coding style with clear structure and comments

## 🧠 Concepts Used

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`)** | Validate input (A–D) and control quiz logic |
| **Loops (`while`)** | Repeat input prompts until a valid answer is provided |
| **Switch-case** | Evaluate each answer and determine correctness |
| **Methods** | `askQuestion()` encapsulates question logic and returns correctness |
| **Arithmetic Operations** | Compute total score and percentage |
| **Input Handling** | `Scanner` class for user input and trimming whitespace |
| **Encapsulation** | Separate logic into reusable methods for clarity |
| **Defensive Programming** | Includes safeguards even for logically unreachable cases |
